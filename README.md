# Kazakhstan Infrastructure Analysis Dashboard

This project provides an interactive dashboard for analyzing the infrastructure state and funding needs across various sectors (e.g., transport, energy, social) in Kazakhstan. The dashboard visualizes key indicators such as the wear levels of infrastructure and sector spending over time, allowing users to track trends and make data-driven decisions for regional prioritization. It also includes an interactive map that displays the priority of regions based on infrastructure condition, helping to guide investments and resource allocation for sustainable development. The tool is designed to assist policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders in assessing infrastructure needs and planning for future investments.
